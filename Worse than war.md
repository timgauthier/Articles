### Scenes from a disaster area: In Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, Dr Dennis Ritter and his comrades began their rescue mission; in the morning they had fought their way into flooded Dernau. Days later, the town centre is covered in rubble.

On 14 July, I was at home, having finished work, when the watch commander of the rescue centre at the Bundeswehr Central Hospital called me at just before 10 pm. He had been asked by the civilian rescue service control centre in Koblenz whether we could put additional vehicles into service for an incipient major emergency in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. The watch commander told me that over the normal rescue service radio we kept hearing: "Road can't be driven on. Flood here. Can't get through." The flood situation was coming to a head. Now, the staff sergeant told me, it was a matter of pulling together larger units in the Heerstraße staging area in Bad Neuenahr - where the barracks used to be. When I heard that, it was clear to me that we wouldn't get anywhere there with normal ambulances. For something like this, we needed all-terrain, wadeable vehicles, for example Unimogs, which can drive into water that is 1.20 metres deep.

Without further ado, I asked the command area of Medical Regiment 2 in Koblenz, the commander, Senior Field Surgeon Dr Markus Widoniak, for off-road equipment. I asked the training and simulation centre, which is also part of our medical regiment, for more vehicles. Then I first informed the national command about the situation. The command post in Mainz was not yet manned. So I asked them - so that everything would go according to plan and we would be covered by insurance - to request assistance directly from the Territorial Tasks Command in Berlin. We are not allowed to simply send troops inland.

Two Unimogs were sent to Trier-Saarburg because there was also a request from there. We left for Ahrweiler at 11 p.m. with three Unimogs, an Eagle IV - a vehicle that is not so wadeable, but is armoured - an intensive care transport vehicle, an emergency doctor's car, an ambulance and a command vehicle. We were 17 comrades, from paramedics to emergency paramedics, even an intensive care nurse and an emergency doctor were there.

I drove ahead with the civilian emergency ambulances to discuss with the command where our all-terrain vehicles would be needed. They arrived at Heerstrasse three quarters of an hour later, around midnight. But the operations centre had to be abandoned already then because of rising flood waters. Most of the rescue workers then moved to the Haribo company in the county. We stayed downstairs and distributed parts of the equipment such as emergency backpacks, medicines, defibrillators from the civilian ambulances to the Unimogs so that we had a complete emergency equipment on the off-road vehicles.

In Ahrweiler, we received the order from the district fire brigade inspector to evacuate the hotel "Lindenmühle" in the street "Am Mühlenteich", where 20 people were trapped. We then set off there with four vehicles. One was immediately fished out because there was an emergency with an infant on the way. On the way to the hotel, we drove through streets where many people were standing in front of the houses. Most of them had nothing on their feet. People had obviously been roused from their sleep by the flood and immediately fled to dry land in the higher streets. We saw many people without shoes that night.

Around half past twelve we reached the hotel. Even boats couldn't do anything there because the current and the objects carried along were too strong. That was crazy. I've experienced quite a bit off-road with the Unimog. But there we were fighting against insane forces. The tyres of the Unimog could not be turned when stationary. The vehicle had to keep moving because there was so much pressure and force acting on it. And again and again, objects bounced against the vehicle.

Then we discovered the hotelier and communicated briefly. We drove a Unimog into deep water under a balcony so that the people who had saved themselves on the first floor could climb onto the roof of the vehicle. Two sergeants met them there. I backed up with my vehicle. Then the people could get into the patient cabin of the Unimog, where we could take care of them. With the first wave, we had 14 people in the cabin.

We just drove them a few streets up to a building site where there was a porta-potty. Taking them to the county would have taken far too long. We had to go back quickly after all, because the water was rising and the people in the hotel were in danger. Besides, we also wanted to rescue the people from the other houses in the street. After all, there was a raging body of water in front of their doors. We then went to the balconies of the houses one by one. This became more and more risky. Further along the street we saw a person sitting outside on a mill wheel. He had been sitting there for three hours and was completely soaked. Because the water was already so deep, we couldn't get close enough to him. So we took a scoop stretcher and used it as a bridge. He was able to crawl over it to us. At this point, I already had water standing in the front of the driver's cab and in the back of the patient's cabin - the water level was already too high.

In total, we had been saving lives in the area for almost three hours. We did not count them. There were probably between 40 and 60. They were all later taken to the county by bus. Then around 3 o'clock we saw that the water level started to drop. That was beautiful.

What was tragic ... I got a call asking if we could drive even closer to the Ahr by road. There, in a house, two people were standing on tables in a semi-basement and drowning. But I had to turn down the assignment. I had to say, "I can't go there. I have to stop here now. Otherwise I'll lose the vehicle." And it would have been life-threatening. By then we had information that the strong current had swept away 16-tonne fire trucks.

You also have to consider that we rescued some very old people from their houses. They had to climb daredevilishly from their roofs so that we could manoeuvre them into our vehicle with two staff-seargents These people were panic-stricken, but at the same time they pulled themselves together desperately. We then had to shout to the two people calling for help that we could not get to them. We shouted through the insanely loud sound of the roaring water, "Wait for help! The water is falling." We couldn't even see them. After all, we could only see as far as our handheld headlamps could shine. What happened to them? We don't know.

Two of our vehicles were sent to save more lives in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. I then drove on the B 267 into the Ahr valley. Shortly after Ahrweiler, the road was already closed. Tree trunks, a huge debris field with pieces of rubble. Then we tried to get further to Dernau via the vineyards. On the way, I was asked to use my Unimog to rescue an 84-year-old woman who had had a new hip seven weeks ago. She lived with her paralysed son, in his mid-40s, in a house. Two floors. Her son must have weighed 80 kilos. She dragged him up the stairs with great difficulty from the ground floor, which was completely flooded. She made it with him to the landing, both feet in the water. They spent the night there. The fire brigade discovered them during the house search in the early morning. They were completely hypothermic. They were in a bad way. But their will to survive gave the woman superhuman strength. We packed them up and took them to the county. It was 7 o'clock. We had a quick snack. Coffee. Toilet. Cigarette.

We then went back down into the Ahr valley. Across the vineyards to Dernau. When we came out at the Marienthal monastery, it was as bright as day. There we really saw for the first time how the flood had raged. At the foot of the monastery, at the level of the beer garden, we could go no further. There were wrecked vehicles, there was mud. Not ten metres further on, the Ahr was flowing, almost 150, or 200 metres from the actual Ahr bed. Then we saw that people were standing in open houses, on roofs, some of them had knocked off the roof tiles so that they could wave. That's when we began to understand the scale of this flood. There were huge gas tanks lying around, pieces of debris, vehicles piled on top of each other.

Our comrades had come to Dernau earlier with the second Unimog. They had set up a patient collection point there at the church. The Ahr had not reached there. There was also a supply point there: some people from Dernau brought food there with their tractors. The fire brigade from Wirges was also there. I don't know how they got there. Fortunately they had a boat with them. We then used the Unimog to push aside wrecked vehicles so that the firefighters could get through. That way we could start getting people out of the accessible houses who needed urgent care. The youngest was a seven-month-old infant who had been born premature. The oldest was a bedridden 94-year-old. We had to drive them to the high ground where they were picked up by ambulances. Only there did we have radio and telephone reception. From 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., we brought more than 100 people from Dernau to safety.

We also saw dead people. Yes. In the Ahr. And as the river receded further, also in many houses. There were open fractures, bruises, soft tissue injuries. And for many, their asthma spiralled out of control. There was a beastly stench in the air because of the ruptured diesel tanks.

The man on the mill wheel in Ahrweiler told us: "I was warned to move my car. When I parked it and went back to my house, I couldn't open the door because there was already water inside. Then I realised that the water was already up to my knees and I escaped onto the mill wheel." Many told us that the water had risen and entered the houses at such a speed that they could only save themselves on the higher floors. Many had to run, some to the roofs. They were scared to death.

I have been on eight foreign missions. Kosovo, Afghanistan, most recently in Mali. That can't be compared to what I saw in the Ahr valley. It was worse than war. There hasn't been such a thing in Germany since the storm surge of 1962. The health situation will be extremely difficult in the Ahr valley in the next few weeks. We have to prevent infectious diseases like cholera or hepatitis A from breaking out.

The Ahr valley came back to me once again on Friday: I was on duty as a senior emergency doctor at the Bundeswehr Central Hospital. In the afternoon, a bus with 25 elderly patients came from the hospital in Ahrweiler to the Bundeswehr Central Hospital. The hospital there had been badly damaged by a mudslide. These people were displaced persons. They were uprooted people, people who had experienced the war as children and now the same again. They looked hopeless, they had no home. It is almost impossible to put it into words. To be able to take these people in, to give them shelter, safety, food, drink, care and to feel their gratitude touched me very much. Until Friday, we had taken in a total of 74 patients from Ahrweiler. In the evening I went home and slept. A few days after the flood disaster, we went to an open-air theatre in Lahnstein. There was laughter, drinking. It was so strange, so surreal.
